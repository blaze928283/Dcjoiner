# How to Use? 
Load tokens in the file tokens.txt in the same directory as the executable. Simply run the executable and enter your discord server invite code.  For multi mode, load your invite CODES in invites.txt
If your invite link is "https://discord.gg/followtos" then the invite code is "followtos" without quotes. This is essential, as of now, the program will only work with invite codes. Simply follow instructions on screen and add all delays in seconds and watch your tokens join the server(s)!
